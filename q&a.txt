>On which basis do we limit the network size?
Set a threshold to investigate only high investment holdings based on the distribution of the investment, for example.
Basically, the limitation is that we need to be able to distinguish the different nodes and edges, not having a visually crowded network.

>In terms of measuring network connectivity, what sort of indicator would we use? Is this to be done over time?
We need to decide this based on our research question.
